/**
 * TZ-255 — Server-side permissions enforcement guard.
 *
 * Authorization ladder:
 *
 *   1. No `@Permissions()` metadata on the handler/class → pass-through.
 *      Rationale: backward-compat with all existing routes that rely on
 *      `@Roles()` only. Routes opt in to permission checks explicitly.
 *
 *   2. `req.user` missing / no `id` → 401 Unauthorized.
 *      Rationale: JwtAuthGuard populates req.user; if it didn't (e.g.
 *      `@Public()` route that the guard is wrongly registered on),
 *      fail explicitly rather than crash on `.role`.
 *
 *   3. Compute `effectivePermissions(req.user, { name: req.user.role,
 *      permissions: req.user.permissions })` via TZ-254 helper. The
 *      union promotion in effectivePermissions handles BOTH:
 *        - role.name === 'admin' → all 29 catalog keys (admin shortcut)
 *        - permissions.includes('*') → all 29 catalog keys (wildcard)
 *
 *   4. Every required key (decorator args) must be present in effective
 *      OR → 403 ForbiddenException. Note: AND-composed with `@Roles`
 *      which runs as a separate APP_GUARD; BOTH must pass.
 *
 * Composability:
 *
 *   - `@Roles('admin','manager')` ∧ `@Permissions('material:write')`
 *     means: user must be admin OR manager AND must have material:write.
 *     RolesGuard handles (1); PermissionsGuard handles (2).
 *
 *   - Shared corporate data (counterparty / product / order / ...) does
 *     NOT need `@Permissions()` if the existing `@Roles()` is
 *     sufficient — for new endpoints only, the canonical contract is
 *     to BOTH add `@Roles()` (legacy compatibility) AND
 *     `@Permissions()` (capability-based for TZ-256 frontend gating).
 *
 * Failure modes:
 *   - 401 ONLY when JwtAuthGuard was bypassed (we still defend so
 *     tests don't crash). Otherwise 401 is JwtAuthGuard's domain.
 *   - 403 when authenticated but missing a required permission key.
 *   - NEVER 404 here — that's `OwnershipGuard` (TZ-251) territory.
